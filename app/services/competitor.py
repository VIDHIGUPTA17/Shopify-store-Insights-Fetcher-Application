# Simple placeholder for competitor discovery.
# You can implement logic such as:
# - Use a search engine API (if available) to query "site:<domain> competitors" or "<brand> competitors"
# - Parse blog lists or curated directories of Shopify stores
# - Use heuristics from footer links like "Our partners" or "You may also like" (cross-links)
# For this template, the endpoint will ignore `with_competitors` or just echo back an empty list.
